          <p><em>(Originally published on my <a href="https://medium.com/@tomasreimers/thoughts-and-drafting-4983ff7572fb">Medium</a>.)</em></p>
<p>In 9th grade I used to talk. A lot.</p>
<p>My photography teacher, who I was very close with — and who is largely responsible for my interest in photography — used to joke that I talked too much. He told me that he wanted me to consolidate my thoughts, and so he assigned me the homework of writing journal entries on various topics: famous photographs, artistic styles, and techniques. The assignments weren’t graded on anything other than completion. He just wanted me to go through the exercise of writing down my thoughts.</p>
<p>To my surprise, I loved that assignment. The journal entries themselves were little more than my transcribed thoughts and the writing was awful; however, the process was helpful. It forced me to think through otherwise nebulous ideas. Articulating something — either through speech or text — forces you to consider the details. It’s easy when thoughts exist only in thought-space to deceive yourself into believing that you understand something or that your idea is fully formed.</p>
<p>My photography teacher loved the assignment because it meant that I talked less in class. I loved the assignment because I found that it helped me form my thoughts. Also, once they were on paper, it was easy to revisit and rework them.</p>
<hr>
<p>Recently, a close friend and mentor gave me similar advice. I was describing a recent idea for a startup, and he told me to write a blog post about it. I told him I didn’t particularly want to share the idea with the world, and he responded that wasn’t the purpose of writing a blog post. It was to consolidate my thoughts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The act of writing your thoughts down consolidates them, gives you a way to share them, and a medium to manipulate them in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think ‘blogging’ (and when I say that I don’t necessarily mean publishing — Medium and many other blog platforms have the ability to let you share drafts without making the draft public) is awesome for a variety of reasons. Two of the most obvious ones are that it forces you to consolidate your thoughts before you share them, and it also gives you a way to share your thoughts with other people. This is why my photography teacher and college mentor both encouraged me to write my thoughts down.</p>
<p>The other benefit that I think many people overlook is that writing your thoughts down gives you a medium to manipulate them in. In many ways, writing something down makes it tangible. I can edit, rework, and rewrite a paper. No one tries to do complicated math in their head, and the same should apply to other forms of thought: write them down so you can think through and work with specific parts.</p>
<p>A while ago I got into the habit of writing down my thoughts as ‘blog posts’ on Medium. Only recently have I started to revisit and edit these drafts. I don’t know how many I’ll publish yet, but I thought I would share the process because it’s been valuable to me so far.</p>
