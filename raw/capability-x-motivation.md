When thinking about someone's work, I usually find it helpful to think about it in terms of capability (what tools they have to produce) and motivation (their willingness to use those tools). This isn't a particularly novel thought, you can find it everywhere from Andy Grove's High Output Management to Situational Leadership.

In terms of capabilities, there tend to be a few things muddled up here:

1. Do they have the literal tools necessary to do their job?
2. Do they have the knowledge to use those tools?
3. Do they have the ability (in a greater sense) to use those tools? Concretely, are there other things going on in their life that would prevent them from taking full advantage of their knowledge and equipment.

Usually, when we are discussing capabilities, we refer to #2. It's presumed that it's a good company's responsibility to take care of #1, and a good manager's responsibility to understand anything that arises in #3.

In those terms, the comparison can then be lifted to a more abstract one. Motivation is like a motor and capability is like a rudder. Without a motor your boat won't go anywhere, and without a rudder (or with a rudder pointed in the wrong direction) it won't make progress. Both are bad. Not going anywhere can be bad for obvious reasons on a team, and expending a lot of energy without going where you want can be equally bad (there used to be a saying at Facebook, "Don't Mistake Motion for Progress").

What always struck me is that a highly motivated individual should be able to improve their own capabilities. That's what learning is. However, that's not always true, you do have individuals that are high in motivation, but low in capability and who stay there. I think that is because there is a third variable worth taking into account: Awareness.

Awareness is what lets someone out in the ocean realize that they're off-course and readjust. More frequently than not, these people have been going somewhere, they just didn't realize it was the wrong direction. There are many reasons this might be the case (from oblivion to arrogance), but ultimately it prevents learning.
