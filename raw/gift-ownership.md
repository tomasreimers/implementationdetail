At the end of the day, ownership--or leadership--comes from someone giving up control to someone you trust to do the role. Necessarily, that means that you open yourself up to evaluation (not just feedback) from that person, otherwise it isn't trust, it's abdication or tyranny.

Now in asking for that trust, you shoudl ask for anything you need. Do you need time to spin up before you want to be evaluated? Do you need control over something else to do your job? Do you need XYZ people to contribute in some way?

And people can choose to give this to you, but ultimately they're entitled to not. It's your job to ask:

1. Can I have this shot?
2. What do I need to do so that you trust me with it?

Generally if you want trust from ppl you have to ask, sometimes this ask is implicit, but by making it explicit you open yourself up vulnerably whic is an important trait for any leader to be able to do (and if you're so insecure that's a problem - there may be a sign you're not yet ready to lead others).
