This isn't a long post, and it's not in response to anything. Probably one of the best pieces of advice I've ever gotten is:

> Never respond to feedback with feedback

There are no exceptions. It's worth memorizing and living by.

When you get unwanted feedback, and especially when it's from someone whom you don't respect or (already) have a dysfunctional working relationship with, it's instinctual to respond with "this is your problem, not mine." The "mature" version of that is to say "well I have feedback for you as well."

It's simply not worth it. It will simultaneously fall on deaf ears, and make the person giving feedback feel unheard. Instead, acknowledge their feedback. If they ask for feedback, respond you need a bit to collect your thoughts or reflect on it and you'll get back to them.
